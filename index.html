    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> I would first of all tell them to not use or visit websites that look strange and untrust worthy, and I would also advice them to never click links from messages or email they dont trust or know of. And when in doubt ask for a second opinion.</p>
